    You need to store the CacheRules at least once into the REDIS store to use the instance.
    This class will return a callback error if a CacheRule configuration already exists for this instance
</p>
<p><strong>A typical workflow: </strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Create and store a new set of CacheRules and stores them into Redis with CacheRuleCreator</li>
    <li>Initialize an instance which loads the CacheRules definition from redis and pools the Redis connections</li>
    <li>Create a new CacheEngine linked to this instance</li>
</ol>
