<pre><code lang="typescript">
url.set(htmlContent: string, extra: Object, force: boolean, callback: Function(err, result: boolean))
</code></pre>

<p>Conditionally stores a URL depending on matching rules</p>


<strong>htmlContent</strong><br /> A non empty string describing the URL content. So far, only UTF-8 has been tested.<br /><br />
<strong>extra</strong><br /> A JSON object representing extra informations. Can be anything, headers, dependecies....<br /><br />
<strong>force</strong><br /> A boolean. If set to true, URL that are already cached are rewritten, URL with the never category are stored anyway, and URL with a TTL will get their ttl updated in addition of the content updated.<br /><br />
<strong>callback(error: string, result: boolean)</strong><br /> A function that returns an error string on error, and a boolean value.
        <b>True</b> when stored successfully and  <b>False</b> in the following scenario:
        <ul>
            <li>The url category is 'never' and force = false</li>
            <li>The url is already cached and force = false.</li>
        </ul>
