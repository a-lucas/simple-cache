    Several cacheEngines can share the same instance, which helps improves performances.
    Although it isn't not really possible yet to share cache between different instance, it is on the roadmap.

<pre><code lang="javascript">
  //will loads the CacheRules related to REST caching strategies
  const instance1 = new Instance('REST', redisConf, err =>{});

  //will loads the CacheRules related to HTML caching strategies
  const instance2 = new Instance('HTML', redisConf, err =>{});

  // cacheEngine 1 & 2 will share the same instance
  const cacheEngine1 = new CacheEngine('http://domain1.com', instance1);
  const cacheEngine2 = new CacheEngine('http://domain2.com', instance1);

  // While cacheEngine 3 will have its own storage space
  const cacheEngine3 = new CacheEngine('http://domain1.com', instance2);



</code></pre>

<p>This helps to logically cluster Redis storage as well as complex Cache Rule configs in very complex scenarios</p>
